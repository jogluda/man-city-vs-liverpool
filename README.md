A familiar foe lies in wait for Manchester City as they return from the international break, with Liverpool ready to deal an almighty blow to the title hopes of their great rivals. The first Premier League game of the weekend could yet be a decisive one in the title race; if Pep Guardiola's side were to win then the pressure would be firmly on Arsenal. Any dropped points, however, and the Gunners could stretch their lead into double figures.

It is, then, an inopportune moment for City to find themselves without Phil Foden and perhaps Erling Haaland. The former will miss the game after an operation on his appendix, the latter is a doubt after withdrawing from international duty with Norway. Here is how you can watch the match and what you need to know:

After a lengthy two-week international break, the English Premier League gets back up and running on Saturday, with this tasty-looking clash between big guns Man City and Liverpool at the Etihad kicking off the weekend's action first on Saturday.

The hosts will be looking to close the gap to league leaders Arsenal, while the Reds will be desperate to keep alive their hopes of finishing in the top four -- with the added incentive of derailing City's title challenge.

Manchester City host Liverpool at the Etihad Stadium in a fixture which could have season defining implications for both teams.

However, Haaland is one of the very few players with a positive ratio, alongside Ivan Toney, Marcus Rashford and Harry Kane among Premier League players with more than three goals.

I feel like Nunez will click eventually, what do you think Liverpool fans let me know below or in my Direct Messages:

After the first international break since the World Cup, two of Englandâ€™s heavyweights square off in a huge matchup for both clubs.

Manchester City start the home stretch of the EPL season hoping to defend their title. However, Arsenal has an eight-point edge. A loss to Liverpool and that could be it, even if City has a game in hand.

Making things even tougher for Man City is a huge injury: Prolific striker Erling Haaland is questionable with a groin problem. He did not play for Norway during the break.

Liverpool has lacked consistency all season. Adding more salt to the wound is this matchup being away from home. Manager Jurgen Kloppâ€™s squad has seen stretches of strong play at Anfield this year, but while away from Liverpool struggles have found them.

Liverpool defeated City in the reverse fixture, 1-0, as lead man from Egypt, Mohamed Salah, broke the draw in the second half. But these two sides also met in the League Cup, which saw manager Pep Guardiolaâ€™s Manchester take a thrilling 3-2 win at the Etihad.

Along with this matchupâ€™s importance to Cityâ€™s title hopes, Liverpool needs three points to keep pace with the top-four Champions League places. The Reds enter the final run of the season in sixth place, six points behind fourth-place Tottenham Hotspur. Liverpool does have two game in hand, but a win is always ideal, especially with their matchups with Arsenal and Chelsea following this one.

The Premier League season resumes this lunchtime at the Etihad Stadium with a fixture which has in recent years been the highlight of the campaign. Reigning champions City welcome usual the Reds to the Etihad Stadium, but the latterâ€™s usual title hopes are long over as they instead bid for an unlikely fourth-placed finish.

The big talking point heading into the game is the fitness of Erling Haaland, who picked up a knock during the international break and is now not expected to feature today. It is a huge blow for City, who will also be without Phil Foden, as they look to keep the pressure on title favourites Arsenal.

Liverpool will be able to welcome back Darwin Nunez from his own fitness concerns as they begin a season-defining final 12 games of a season which has largely been well below expectations. Follow the game LIVE below with our dedicated match blog below!

Liverpool have stepped up in some of the bigger games this season but City looked to be hitting ominous form before the break. If Haaland plays, Kloppâ€™s leaky defence surely do not have enough to stop him at the Etihad.

Manchester City possible starting lineup:
Ederson; Walker, Dias, Laporte; Rodri, Lewis; Mahrez, De Bruyne, Gundogan, Grealish; Haaland.

Liverpool possible starting lineup:
Becker; Alexander-Arnold, Konate, van Dijk, Robertson; Gakpo, Fabinho, Milner; Salah, Jota, Nunez.

Liverpool tend to raise their game whenever facing off against City and with so much at stake for Klopp's men, they might just deliver a good enough performance to get something at the Etihad. PICK: Manchester City 2, Liverpool 2

The break arguably came at a bad time for City, with the defending champs having won each of their last six games across all competitions. Striker Erling Haaland scored an incredible eight goals in City's last two games against RB Leipzig and Burnley, but the Norwegian faces a late fitness test for Saturday's clash.

Liverpool have a poor record at the Etihad, having only won one of their last 13 top-flight away meetings with City. 

Boss JÃ¼rgen Klopp will nevertheless draw encouragement from his side's 1-0 win in the reverse fixture at Anfield back in October, a match that was arguably the Reds' best performance of the season so far.

Itâ€™s the champions welcoming the fourth-placed hopefuls in a game usually picked up as a title-decided fixture. Not this season though, but both teams still need a victory to keep their end-of-season aims on track.

City must win to avoid Arsenal moving even further clear at the top, while anything less than a win for the Reds will make the tough task of finishing fourth almost impossible.
